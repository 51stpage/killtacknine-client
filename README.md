# killtacknine-client

KillTackNine is a commandline-only real time strategy game. Basically, KT9 aims to implement an RTS in a time when GUIs were only a twinkle in Xerox's eye. 

The KT9 client is intended to fit comfortably into a normal Linux/Unix shell environment where all the normal shell tools and techniques should work to pipe commands into or out of the client.  Commandline tools are incredibly powerful and it is hoped that the KT9 client will allow players to bring those considerable tools and skills to bear.
